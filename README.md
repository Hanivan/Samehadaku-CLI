#### The Reason Behind Making This App

Because I like watching anime. I'm sometimes bothered by annoying ads. So I decided to make the [restAPI](https://github.com/Hanivan/restAPI-Samehadaku) first, then this application was created, and this application is made based on hobbies, so I do not guarantee this application runs as it should. So just enjoy. I will also update this application later
